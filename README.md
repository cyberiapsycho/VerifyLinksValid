# VerifyLinksValid

A simple tool to check the linksâ€™ validity status.

The program is written in Python.

## How to use

**Note:** Now it's only working on Google Colab.

Firstly, you need to copy all the code in verifyLinksValid.py to your Google Colab notebook.

Then, you need to create a .txt file named "links.txt" whose content is the links you want to check, one link per line. After running the code, you'll be requested to upload the file. Upload your "links.txt" file and wait for the program to run. 

If it's working perfectly, it will show you the count of valid links and all the invalid links.

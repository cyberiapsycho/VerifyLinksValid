# VerifyLinksValid
A simple tool to check the links's valid status.

The program is written by Python. You need to install the requests library and tqdm.

## How to use

You need to create a .txt file named "links.txt" whose content is the links you want to check, one by one line. After running the code, you'll be requested to upload the file. Upload your "links.txt" file and waiting for the program running. 

If it's working perfectly, it will show you the count of valid links and all the invalid links.
